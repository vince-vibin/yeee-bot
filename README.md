# yeee-bot
YeeeeBot is a Discord Bot i made out of boredom two years ago. I recently picked it up again and finished it.
> The Bot is not really nice so it is scientificly proven that only big people can use him
## Setup on your Discord Server:
[Add YeeeeBot to your server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=728319090510528602&permissions=277025516544&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

When the Bot is on your server do `/help`.<br/>
To get more info about specific commands you can use `/help` with the arguments:
```
/help animals
/help basic
/help fun
/help games
/help reddit
```
Now just have fun with it :)

## More info:
The Bot also has a really fancy Dashboard using InfluxDB, wich i spend waaaaayy to much time on.<br/>
Data is collected in the [influxdbMetrix.py](/cogs/influxdbMetrix.py) file. and send of in the [influxdbExport.py](/influx/influxdbExport.py) <br/>
To flex here is a picture of it:<br/>
--- will be uploaded when this goes public ---<br/>
Also just so you know all the secrets are stored in a **obviosly** not pushed `.env` file and imported where needed.

## Help
If you have problems with the bot or just want to shit my bad code feel free to: <br/>

(Also you can just hang out on my server, it's pretty cool ðŸŒš)
